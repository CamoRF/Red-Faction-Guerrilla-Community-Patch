------------------
v1.08 BETA CHANGES
------------------
[New Weapon]
* Added experimental Light Machine Gun
* Added DLC Marauder Remote Charges to MP (hopefully, if RfgUtil can support peg files)
* Added DLC Pickaxe to MP
* Added DLC Royal Sword to MP

[Interface]
* Initial loading screen updated to current patch version
* Added several new placeholder textures for future map loading screens, thumbnails and character thumbnails to make it easier to add new textures in the future without tedious hex editing

[Singleplayer]
* Increased population density
* Added DLC Marauder Vehicles to Base SP, Marauders can spawn with them and you can also find them at the Badlands safehouse
* Added Base SP Marauder Vehicles to DLC SP
* Added DLC Weapons to Base SP (Add details like all the weapons in own line, add other weapons etc)
* Added Bulldozer vehicle spawn to all safehouses

[Misc]
* Added SP DLC precache assets to "mp_common.vpp_pc", will be useful for transferring SP DLC map assets to MP maps in the future
* Re-added comments for changes the patch makes to ".xtbls", they don't seem to cause issues since some vanilla .xtbl files use them and the game ignores entries that are commented out
* Patch rebuilt "hopefully" for the last time to reduce file size using the new loose file feature in SyncFaction 
* Reduced loading times in multiplayer (misc, table, mp_common and INSERT files here are now uncompressed + uncondensed)
* Reverted some more out of scope changes in "tweak_table.xtbl" & added comments for gameplay add-on in future

[Weapons]
