------------------

[Misc]
* Added colored names to new MP characters in menu
* Added SP DLC precache assets to "mp_common.vpp_pc", will be useful for transferring SP DLC map assets to MP maps in the future

* Patch rebuilt "hopefully" for the last time to reduce file size using the new loose file feature in SyncFaction

* Renamed Marauder Lady character to Camie (her actual name in the files)

* Optimized "lod_properties.xtbl" to improve performance while still improving draw distance
