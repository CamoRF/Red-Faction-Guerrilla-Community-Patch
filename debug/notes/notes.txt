NOTES
*----*

* rfgcommunitypatch
* rfgcommunityupdate3
* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 
* Test adding more than 2 flag stands
* Siege maps has something with persistent flags used on most objects
* Siege maps persistent objects other than the objective don't spawn? or is it just framework?
* Ladders: does making them orphans make them remain usable for longer when buildings are partially damaged?
* King of the Hill targets, Flag capture zones, Spawn nodes, Spectator cameras have values related to backpack racks which are possibly redundant, test if removing these doesn't break objectives.
* Framework: MP version of crane asset?
* Health pickups
* Updated weather files in dlc3 misc file or removing them there since misc seems to override it?
* Can dlc02_text and dlc03_text be merged into misc.vpp_pc?
