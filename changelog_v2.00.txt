v2.00 CHANGES
--------------

[New Weapons]
* Added experimental Light Machine Gun
* Added DLC Pickaxe to MP
* Added DLC Royal Sword to MP
* Added DLC Marauder Remote Charges to MP (hopefully, if RfgUtil can support peg files)	

[Weapon Balance]
* Grenade (need to compare changes and add notes)
* Rocket launcher damage to buildings (same as above)

[Interface]
* Initial loading screen updated to current patch version
* Added several new placeholder textures for future map loading screens, thumbnails and character thumbnails to make it easier to add new textures in the future without tedious hex editing

[Singleplayer]

[Misc]
* Added SP DLC precache assets to "mp_common.vpp_pc", will be useful for transferring SP DLC map assets to MP maps in the future
* Re-added comments for changes the patch makes to ".xtbls", they don't seem to cause issues since some vanilla .xtbl files use them and the game ignores entries that are commented out

* Reverted some more out of scope changes in "tweak_table.xtbl" & added comments for gameplay add-on in future
