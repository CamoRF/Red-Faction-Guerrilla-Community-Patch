* DLC: NPC MIGHT drive off near the cliff near the large bridge during Redemption mission (with uncapped fps or due to bad road path on the map?)
* DLC: Lack of checkpoints in Redemption mission; eg: after you rescue the prisoners
* DLC: First transporter mission is broken
* DLC: "Weapon with name "missilepod" is trying to use inventory item info "missilepod", but that is already being used by weapon "missilepod"! etc" reported in Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered.log
* DLC: Weapons that have been ported to the base game have broken icons (due to the DLC loading weapons.xtbl & overriding the dlc01 weapon xtbl, it should be resolved when reticules & icons can be ported to the base game or a work around is found by changing the dlc weapons to be unique from the ported ones)

[Maps]
* Most wrecking crew maps are missing team spawns
* Most wrecking crew maps still need more spawns &/or fixes to existing spawns
* Wrecking crew maps in general are not final
* Abandoned terrain collision glitch near forcefield near 335.016, -0.205, -321.099
* Expansion: crates on top of the bridge float even when the bridge is destroyed for an unknown reason
* Frost: sections of the crane & smokestack can float when they are partially destroyed, could be fixed by transferring a multiplayer version of the crane to the map that doesn't use constraints
* Frost: minor gap to void in terrain near 218.371, -21.350, -298.267
* Ruins: Damage Control currently crashes for unknown reason so that mode isn't implemented on this map yet

[Textures]
* Typo (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* eos_war_memorial dates are wrong; it should be 2075 & 2077, its 5 years off

[DLC Weapons]
* Pickaxe: missing textures; not implemented yet

* Weapons use placeholder icons & reticules for now
* Weapon icons are broken in singleplayer due to the new placeholder icons only loading in multiplayer [REVERTED IN v1.07]

[Backpacks]
* Kaboom backpack has floating objects on the model
* Backpacks MIGHT clip through the characters on some of the new models?, this can be fixed by fine tuning the offset axis values but will take time
* Some backpacks clip through Alec Masons model in singleplayer?
* Floating backpacks on players when they first spawn?, seems to be related to high ping

[Characters]
* New characters use a generic placeholder texture for now
* New character names have !! in front of them for now

[Misc]
* "Int3 critical function at C:/unit4projects/rfg/root/code/volition/interface_lib/code/vint_string_processing.cpp(1465)" when using [format][color:#1a71ac][/format] in kaiko ini file reported in Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered.log
* "Length of string pool exceeded" when adding too many level name characters to mp_levels.xtbl reported in Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered.log
