------------
|KNOWN BUGS|
------------

[Singleplayer]
* Flat beds and other large vehicles can blow up the Oasis safehouse when they spawn
* NPCs have trouble with handling larger vehicles
* Vehicle spawn locations aren't final

[Missions]
* The first DLC transporter might be broken due to the vehicle not spawning for some unknown reason, uninstall the patch to complete this mission and then you can safetly reinstall after you've finished it

[DLC Weapons]
* Pickaxe and Impaler have missing textures so they are not implemeneted yet
* Spiker has missing texture when it's dropped on the ground and only the host can see the projectile so it's not implemented yet
* Weapons use placeholder icons and reticules for now
* Weapon icons are broken in singleplayer due to the new placeholder icons only loading in multiplayer
* Misslepod sometimes shows up as the rocket in killfeed, other times it shows up as the Marauder icon

[Backpacks]
* Kaboom backpack has floating objects on the model
* Kaboom pack might not show up in random backpack rotation on any map possibly due to there not being a backpack rack on the map
* Random backpack option doesn't work on wrecking crew maps possibly due to there not being backpack racks on the maps yet
* Backpacks might clip through the characters on some of the new models, this can be fixed by fine tuning the offset axis values but will take time

[Maps]
* Complex and Watchtower have gamebreaking crashing issues, AVOID PLAYING THEM!
* Gamemodes other than Team Anarchy, Anarchy, Demolition, Team Bagman and Bagman will not work on any Wrecking Crew map until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add siege, CTF and damage control objectives to maps
* Gamemodes other than Team Anarchy, Anarchy, Demolition, Team Bagman, Bagman and Siege will not work on Siege maps until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add CTF and damage control objectives to maps
* Some maps with night might be overly bright, will be fixed when the weather and lighting files are understood more
* There might be some maps missing the slight bloom reduction tweak, these will be fixed throughout development as there's a lot of weather and lighting files and it's very tedious to work on them; most maps seem to be fixed however
* Lack of fog on various maps including Complex, will be fixed when the weather and lighting files are more understood
* Some maps might have extreme fog when using the alternative time of day
* Wrecking crew maps don't have backpack spawns until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add them
* Gulch has a lot of empty space outside the map
* Scrapheap has a spawn where you can get stuck in a frame
* Ruins has issues with some of the rocks being hard to climb
* Ruins has issues with some of the spikes on the buildings causing players to get stuck
* Repurcussion might need adjustments to some of the spawns inside the pipes
* GFWL/Nordic Bonus: Some of the shipping containers are floating

[Characters]
* EDF heavy changed to the white model in team games due to a bug with new characters
* The following multiplayer characters were cut so their UI textures could be re-used for new characters or other uses, they will be restored when it's possible to add new textures to the game instead of only replacing: Numah, Jake, Kayla, Selma, Blair, Bev & Jake
* Some of the new characters have placeholder thumbnails for now as I wasn't able to find any in game textures to use and they will need to made from scratch
* New character names have !! in front of them because I haven't figured out how to add proper menu entry strings yet

[Vanilla]
* Walkers don't spawn sometimes
* Issue with extreme cloud speed on some maps
* Various maps still have bugs with out of bounds spots
* Debris collision and despawn limit changes don't apply to multiplayer most likely due to hardcoded networking optimizations
* LOD cap for small rocks seems to be hardcoded and cannot be increased further
* Projectile despawn rate seems to be hardcoded and cannot be increased further
* Adding walker spawns at safehouses can cause no vehicle to spawn at all occasionally 
* NPCs driving like crazy when obstructed instead of waiting and going around them calmly
* Game can sometimes crash when loading into a multiplayer match
* Some backpacks clipping through Alec Mason in singleplayer
* Floating backpacks on players when they first spawn, seems to be related to high ping
* Siege objectives and weapon pickups can sometimes desync in multiplayer

[Wrecking Crew Mode]
* Maps don't have barrels and might crash, alternative solutions will be sought after in the future such as attempting to add entirely new .vpp_pc map files instead of replacing the maps
