|KNOWN BUGS|
------------

[Singleplayer]
* Flat beds and other large vehicles can blow up the Oasis safehouse when they spawn
* Tanks and the bulldozer scare NPCs and they drive like maniacs
* NPCs have trouble with handling larger vehicles
* Vehicle spawn locations aren't final
* Vanilla bug when making walkers spawn at safehouses can cause no vehicle to spawn at all occasionally 
* Vanilla bug with NPCs driving like crazy when obstructed instead of waiting and going around them calmly

[Missions]
* The first DLC transporter might be broken due to the vehicle not spawning for some unknown reason, uninstall the patch to complete this mission and then you can safetly reinstall after you've finished it

[DLC Weapons]
* DLC melee weapons: Implemented but disabled due to a missing texture bug
* DLC weapons: They use placeholder icons and reticules currently
* DLC weapon: Spiker model is missing textures when dropped on the ground
* DLC weapon: Spiker is implemented but disabled in multiplayer due to an issue where if you're not the host the projectile is invisible
* DLC weapons: Super Gauss needs to be added to more EDF loadouts in singleplayer
* DLC weapons: Spiker and misslepod need to be added to Marauder loadouts in singleplayer

[Backpacks]
* Kaboom backpack has floating objects on the model
* Kaboom pack might not show up in random backpack rotation on any map possibly due to there not being a backpack rack on the map
* Kaboom pack sounds can get stuck when you die sometimes
* Random backpack option doesn't work on wrecking crew maps possibly due to there not being backpack racks on the maps yet
* Vanilla bug with floating backpacks on players when they first spawn, seems to be related to high ping
* Backpacks might clip through the characters on some of the new models, this can be fixed by fine tuning the offset axis values but will take time
* Vanilla bug with some backpacks clipping through Alec Mason in singleplayer

[Maps]
* Gamemodes other than Team Anarchy, Anarchy, Demolition, Team Bagman and Bagman will not work on any Wrecking Crew map until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add siege, CTF and damage control objectives to maps
* Gamemodes other than Team Anarchy, Anarchy, Demolition, Team Bagman, Bagman and Siege will not work on Siege maps until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add CTF and damage control objectives to maps
* Some maps with night might be overly bright, will be fixed when the weather and lighting files are understood more
* There might be some maps missing the slight bloom reduction tweak, these will be fixed throughout development as there's a lot of weather and lighting files and it's very tedious to work on them; most maps seem to be fixed however
* Lack of fog on various maps including Complex, will be fixed when the weather and lighting files are more understood
* Vanilla bug with siege objectives desyncing
* Some maps might have extreme fog when using the alternative time of day
* Wrecking crew maps don't have backpack spawns until the Nanoforge modding tool allows us to add them

[Characters]
* EDF heavy changed to the white model in team games due to a bug with new characters
* The following multiplayer characters were cut so their UI textures could be re-used for new characters or other uses, they will be restored when it's possible to add new textures to the game instead of only replacing: Numah, Jake, Kayla, Selma, Blair, Bev & Jake
* Some of the new characters have placeholder thumbnails for now as I wasn't able to find any in game textures to use and they will need to made from scratch
* New character names have !! in front of them because I haven't figured out how to add proper menu entry strings yet

[Vanilla]
* Vanilla bug with walkers not spawning sometimes
* Vanilla issue with extreme cloud speed on some maps
* Various maps have vanilla bugs with out of bounds spots, these will be fixed when Nanoforge supports invisible walls
* Debris collision and despawn limit changes don't apply to multiplayer most likely due to hardcoded networking optimizations
* LOD cap for small rocks seems to be hardcoded and cannot be increased further
* Projectile despawn rate seems to be hardcoded and cannot be increased further

[Wrecking Crew Mode]
* Maps don't have barrels and might crash, alternative solutions will be sought after in the future such as attempting to add entirely new .vpp_pc map files instead of replacing the maps
