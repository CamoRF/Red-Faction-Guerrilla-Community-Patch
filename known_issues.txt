|KNOWN ISSUES|
--------------

[Singleplayer]
* Activity: Offensive raid at top right of Oasis MIGHT not be beatable due to EDF spawns stopping before you destroy enough vehicles (might be fixed after re-doing all spawn related changes) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* Activity: See screenshot "sp_eos_side_mission.png" MIGHT be broken (might be fixed after re-doing all spawn related changes) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* Activity: Transporter activity in Badl&s MIGHT be broken (might be fixed after re-doing all spawn related changes) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* Misc: Marauders might not spawn with shotguns? (might be fixed in v1.064.1 due to reverting changes to squad files) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* Misc: NPCs drive like crazy when obstructed instead of waiting & going around them calmly
* Misc: Setting walkers to spawn at safehouses can cause no vehicles to spawn, this was a bug introduced in the remaster
* Misc: EDF spawn very close to the player
* DLC: Tank doesn't spawn in Redemption mission (might be fixed after re-doing all spawn related changes) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* DLC: Related broken mission files: "zonescript_dlc01.vpp_pc\dlc01_finale_mission3.scriptx (might be fixed after re-doing all spawn related changes) [REVERTED IN v1.07]
* DLC: NPC MIGHT drive off near the cliff near the large bridge during Redemption mission (with uncapped fps or due to bad road path on the map?)
* DLC: Lack of checkpoints in Redemption mission; eg: after you rescue the prisoners
* DLC: First transporter mission is broken [REVERTED in v1.07]
* Weapons that have been ported to the base game have broken icons (due to the DLC loading weapons.xtbl & overriding the dlc01 weapon xtbl, it should be resolved when reticules & icons can be ported to the base game or a work around is found by changing the dlc weapons to be unique from the ported ones)

[Maps]
* New maps have placeholder name "CUSTOM GAME", this will be resolved when adding custom strings is possible
* Abandoned: Terrain collision glitch near forcefield near 335.016, -0.205, -321.099
* Expansion: Crates on top of the bridge float even when the bridge is destroyed
* Expansion: Killbox near cliff warning sign needs refinement
* Frost: Sections of the crane & smokestack can float when they are partially destroyed
* Ruins: Damage Control currently crashes for unknown reason so that mode isn't implemented on this map yet
* Factory: The killbox for the canyon/cliff in the middle of the map is too high and you can die near the edge in a spot that doesn't make sense
* Nanoforge issue: Cloned objects not having gravity not apply to them (see Expansion, Frost, Aerial Excavation)
* Nanoforge issue: Cloned objects that have constaints having strange physics (see Frost)
* Most wrecking crew maps are missing team spawns and the CTF spawn flipping fix will not apply on these maps
* Most wrecking crew maps still need more spawns &/or fixes to existing spawns
* Wrecking crew maps in general are not final
* New Siege Maps: Most of them are lacking proper spawns and might be chaotic

[Textures]
* Typo (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* eos_war_memorial dates are wrong; it should be 2075 & 2077, its 5 years off
* Marauder lady has some missing textures
* "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)

[Weapons]
* Grenade weapon has strange ammo count

[DLC Weapons]
* Pickaxe: Missing textures; not implemented yet
* Impaler: Missing textures; not implemented yet
* Spiker: Missing textures when it's dropped on the ground and sometimes when another player has it, sometimes only the host can see the projectile
* Misslepod: Sometimes shows up as the rocket in killfeed, other times it shows up as the Marauder icon
* Marauder Remote Charges: missing textures; not implemented yet
* Weapons use placeholder icons & reticules for now
* Weapons will still remain on the map even when all map weapon spawns are disabled in the custom match settings

[Backpacks]
* Kaboom backpack has floating objects on the model
* Backpacks MIGHT clip through the characters on some of the new models?, this can be fixed by fine tuning the offset axis values but will take time
* Some backpacks clip through Alec Masons model in singleplayer?
* Floating backpacks on players when they first spawn, seems to be related to high ping and might be caused by desync of the backpack offsets

[Characters]
* New characters use a generic placeholder texture for now
* New character names have !! in front of them for now
* Marauder lady is missing some textures
* The following characters have been temporarily removed from the multiplayer roster due to a hardcoded limit: Torvald, Bev, Chuck, Selma, Kayla, Blair, Numah, & Pierce; they will be restored with RSL2

[Misc]
* "Int3 critical function at C:/unit4projects/rfg/root/code/volition/interface_lib/code/vint_string_processing.cpp(1465)" when using [format][color:#1a71ac][/format] in kaiko ini file reported in Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered.log
* "Length of string pool exceeded" when adding too many level name characters to mp_levels.xtbl or going over character_grid limit in characters.xtbl reported in Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered.log; should be fixed with RSL2
* LOD cap for small rocks seems to be hardcoded & cannot be increased further without hacking the .exe
* Game can sometimes crash when loading into a multiplayer match; possibly related to low memory pools and should be fixed with RSL2
* Siege objectives & weapon pickups can sometimes desync in multiplayer; probably caused by high ping
* Multiplayer lobbies frequently break, players cannot join the lobby unless they go back to the main menu or restart their game; unknown why this happens but possibly related to THQN Servers
* Issue with double text for you won/you lost text at end of game with large text over the top of small text in MP; not really a major issue
* Profile saving hud element can sometimes get stuck on screen in multiplayer games on rare occasions; not really a major issue
