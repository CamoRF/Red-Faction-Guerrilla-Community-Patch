v1.06x
------------

[Fixes]
* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* Fix grenade (seems to randomly stop working when played online and character tposes, weapon also breaks if unique ID is changed from 33, might need to be scripted in future)
* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
* Fix grinder projectile texture
* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket
* Use mp_explosion_overrides.xtbl for explosion changes so it doesn't mess with singleplayer

[Maps]
* Add a single kaboom pack spawn with only 1 on the rack on overpass and crevice
* Add cliff under maps that are missing it when bounding box makes sense
* Add CTF, Damage Control objectives and backpack racks to WC maps when Nanoforge supports it
* Add more neutral spawns to Siege maps (Framework done)

* Fix out of bounds spots on Excavation, Remnant, Puncture, Warlords and Gradient
* Fix random backpacks on WC maps (requires adding backpack racks I believe)

* Scrapheap: very large and needs mines around the map, has a spawn where you can get stuck in a frame
* Gulch: very large and needs mines around the map
* Ruins: has issues with some of the rocks being hard to climb and the player can get stuck on the spikes on buildings
* Repurcussion: might need adjustments to some of the spawns inside the pipes
* GFWL/Nordic Bonus: Some of the shipping containers are floating
* Complex: remake it from scratch using the vanilla map file
* Watchtower: remake it from scratch using the vanilla map file
* Expansion: make bridge changes cleaner when we can clone between maps
* Overpass: needs to be reworked, attackers spawn right next to the shed on the left side of the map, needs more siege objectives
* Pinaccle: experimental spawn flipping fixes that apply only in CTF (try intial and respawn bools for team spawns)

* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns
* Update WC map thumbnails after the maps are polished

* Quarantine: when it's possible to add new map files make a version of it without mines and out in the crators
* Scrapheap: when it's possible to add new map files make a version of it without mines with lots of structures up until the invisible wall
* Gulch: when it's possible to add new map files make a version of it without the mines with lots of towers, spawns, weapons around the currently empty part of the map
* All WC maps: when it's possible to add new map files, add all the vanilla versions back and update wrecking_crew_maps.xtbl to restore barrels

[Additions/Changes]
* .exe with match countdown set to 6 seconds
* .exe with match end countdown set to 6 seconds
* Remove blur from RPG explosions?
* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines?
* Improve driving skills of NPCs
* Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to
the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
* Reduce mass of debris
* Merge items from SP and DLC into mp_common.vpp_pc

[Weapons]
* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer if possible and when the dlc melee weapons are added
* Fix spiker missing texture when on ground and the projectile not being visible for other players if they are not the host, Broken DLC weapons might need to be merged into items_mp.vpp_pc? (maybe try an alternative projectile?), testing changing the streaming value to multiplayer in items_3d.xtbl, Try dragging the asm files onto RFGUtil to fix DLC weapons, test remaking the changes to items.vpp_pc
* Fix DLC weapon selection icons and reticules, maybe the bitmap file is important?

NOTES
-----
* Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
  Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
  Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
  Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 

* I'd balance it generally around Normal and Hard as the defaults.
  Casual is pretty self-explanatory, and Insane would be a semi-realistic guerrilla warfare simulation.
  Then the game has something to offer everyone. You can sandbox and dick around with little trouble, get an average middle of the road mix of challenge and story, get a balanced challenge that requires you to use hit and run tactics with forward thinking, or get a true realistic challenge of guerrilla skill and tactics that will push you in a desperate struggle for freedom. 

* Stealth in vanilla is pretty much useless, so implementing those fixes would make stealth a much more viable option. I think in general we want to lean the player towards using guerrilla tactics on higher difficulties.
  Encourage hit and run and stealth
