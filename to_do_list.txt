NOTE: A lot of this to do list was merged in from the old v1.07 changelog, some of it might already be implemented in v1.064\v1.064.1. Doublecheck and clean up entire to do list when possible.

[Weapons]
	* Spiker: missing textures when on ground, only host can see the projectile (peg file related most likely)
	* DLC remote charges: missing textures, missing mesh when thrown (peg file related most likely)
	* Pickaxe and Impaler: missing textures in all circumstances (peg file again)
	* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer and when the dlc melee weapons are added
	* Weapon ideas: 
		- Singularity launcher
		- Gauss shotgun, 
		- Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to 	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
	* Add Spiker to singleplayer and add it to Marauder loadout
