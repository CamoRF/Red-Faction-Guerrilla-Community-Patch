-------------------
LOW PRIORITY 
-------------------

[Weapons]
	* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer if possible and when the dlc melee weapons are added
	* Weapon ideas: Singularity launcher, Gauss shotgun, Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to
	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
	* Add Spiker to singleplayer and add it to Marauder loadout
	* Fix DLC weapon selection icons and reticules, maybe the bitmap file is important?, maybe RfgUtil update will help?	

[Fixes]
	* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
	* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
	* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
	* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
	* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket		
	* Issue with double text for the you won/you lost text at end of game with large text over the top of small text	

[Maps] 	
	* Add packs missing from maps to 0,0,0 so they show up in random backpack rotation - wip
	* Add another Subverter to Gauntlet, Garrison and Downfall	
	* Add team spawns to all WC maps
	* Add more cameras to GFWL/Nordic Bonus	and Repurcussion	
	* Tutorial area map
	* Watchtower siege
	* Gulch siege
	* Pipeline siege	
	* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 	
	* Overpass: needs to be reworked, attackers spawn right next to the shed on the left side of the map, needs more siege objectives	
	* Repurcussion: might need adjustments to some of the spawns inside the pipes?
	* Double check all WC maps have a disabled barrel at 0,0,0

[Misc]
	* Move other non essential gameplay changes to add-on when the patch is final (alert_level.xtbl for example)	
	* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines if possible
	* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
	* Half cloud speed on all maps	
	
[Missions]
	* NPC drives off the cliff in Redemption near the large bridge (see screenshot)

OTHER PROJECTS/ADDONS/OUT OF SCOPE/NOTES
------------------------------------------------

* HD character textures 
* HD weapons and backpack textures
* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Increase morale drop for death
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth
