MISC
----
* Fix broken sun texture on Assembly/Outpost

* Add comments for string names in .xtbl files
* Doublecheck host migration removal fix

BACKPACKS
----------
* Try to fix how stealth pack casts a player shadow that other players can see

TEXTURE FIXES
-------------
* See known bugs in changelog.txt

WRECKING CREW MODE
------------------
* Fallfactor, overpass, deadzone and crash site wrecking crew versions when NF rewrite is out so I can see general movers and fix floating barrels

WEAPONS
-------
* Grenade and fist weapons
* Singularity that explodes in 1 second named Instant Singularity Bomb
* Fix DLC weapon icons and reticules by figuring out how to port them to the base game, something to do with bitmap.xtbl and peg files
* Retexture super gauss rifle to make it easier to tell apart from regular gauss rifle? (white?)
* Implement Royal Sword, Pickaxe, Marauder Remote Charges when the peg tool is out
* Weapon ideas: Singularity launcher, Gauss shotgun, Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to 	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
* Misslepod: too much smoke and particles for such small damage
* Spiker: still too weak, takes a lot of shots to kill, maybe increase clip size slightly and increase damage, increase headshot multiplier
* Reconstructor effect not appearing randomly, test if restarting game fixes it
* Reduce or remove sledge hammer aim assist?: there's a variable for it set to 0.75 in weapons.xtbl
* Pistol: too finnicky to use?
* Rail driver: maybe it should turn red at a longer distance, maybe the start and max speed for the projectile should be the same?
* Overpowered version of weapons: Grinder etc

SINGLEPLAYER
------------
* Make it so you don't lose alert level when going to a safehouse
* NPC and vehicle overhaul
* Re-port DLC vehicles to base game when modinfo.xml is supported in SF
* Try to make NPCs respond to player from longer distances 
* Increase squad sizes (x8 for workers/rf, x4 for EDF)
* Overhaul vehicle handling
* Re-implement DLC weapons
* Re-implement misc changes (see reverted changes in changelog.txt)
* Try to make it so EDF withdraw from liberated sectors (see territories.xtbl)
* Fix EDF/NPCs spawning really close to player: (tweak_table.xtbl, spawn_parameters.xtbl) and other squad files?
* EDF attack on sight if you're holding a gun 
* Hit and run gameplay on higher difficulties
* EDF should be hostile if you have weapons on your vehicle
* Try to fix not being able to fast travel in Dust
* Add vehicles driving on roads without traffic like FFZ and EOS end game after the missions are completed
* Ore deposits drop 1 piece of salvage instead of 2
* Make it so you can't buy all the backpacks from the start 
* EOS Edf Assault Command Mission: Ally NPCs need to be more aggressive and fight beside you but get stuck and lag behind the player, would be better if they could push foward better as enemies are cleared out, buff number of friendlies as only 4 guerrillas and marauders spawn at a time. (eos_edf_command_assault.png)
* The hammer should be less powerful
* Stealth should last 7 sec
* The aptly named Rhino "charge" isn't a charge, but a step forward.
* Reduce the price of Heal, Tremor and Jetpack (300>200/300>200/ 700>600+300 for recharge). 
* Increase the price of Rhino, Damage boost and Stealth by 25%. The rest of the packs that I haven't mentioned don't need changes. 
* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
* Guerilla Express unlocks in 3-8 Guerrilla Actions
* 290 out of 300 deposits but you have 6000> salvage. 
* Increase morale drop for death
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Not enough checkpoints for missions
* Allies are useless, worse they will get in your line of fire and if you are firing a thermobaric rocket and kill yourself.
* Civilians run around aimlessly while you are trying to finish a mission (sniper mission in EOS especially)
* Unlimited enemies that keep spawning right behind you (pet peeve of mine in games)
* Receive no salvage (including morale bonus) from missions.
* More checkpoints 	
* Speaking of Badlands, makes little sense that both RF and EDF can spawn in the Irradiated Zone. I think that's also a result of 1.063?
* More usage for salvage: upgrading vehicles (swapping out vehicles for ones with guns, repairing vehicles, adding armor, adding moab from safehouse)
* Bug with essential bridge not spawning near the end of the game: non destructible bridge has only half loaded in and means you can't finish the game. One of the last missions you're tasked with destroying enemies and protecting a truck to its destination, issue is you're not following the truck yourself, you're tracking it with a missile launcher and the truck goes to where this bridge should be and drops down and loops back round over and over again.
  The game itself thinks it's there, in and out of mission the AI just straight drives off it, waypoints (which normally divert around destroyed bridges) just go straight across the gap.

RUINS INTERIOR MAP
------------------

SANDPIT KOTH
-------------
* Use puncture weather and time of day
* Transfer heat haze and fire assets to map 
* Small smokestack in distance is too high
* 180 the small shack near the middle of the map
* Raise the large building added a tiny bit
* Fence clipping through one of the smokestacks
* Add more objects outside the maybe
* Attempt to transfer the solar tower asset from cascade or gauntlet and add it at that empty area at the opposite side of the map as the large building
* Move the shack next to it closer to the middle, next to the fence/backpacks

MISC (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
---------------------------
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* More fleshed out world with more buildings etc
* HD character textures
* HD weapon textures
* HD decals
* HD effects
* HD cubemap in always loaded in misc.vpp
* HD backpacks

* Could extract the old HD loading screens and thumbnails from old version of patch
* WC versions of Quarantine, Excavation, Rift, Fallfactor, Crashsite and Deadzone
* Kill unkillable NPCs
* You can replace Alec in SP by directly porting DLC sam, rfg_pc_dlc overwrites his file? (player_female.xtbl could maybe be used to fix player model swaps in SP)

NEW MISSIONS (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
-----------------------------------
* Missions where you fly the EDF fliers or bombers and take out EDF bases on mountains 
* Stunt jump activities
* More demo master activities 
* EDF counter attack set after main story (based on Sams post game dialogue)
* Mission where you destroy the EDF fliers, you can kill everyone and you get a red alert
* Space asshole: player causes as much chaos in a given sector while being attacked by progressively more overwhelming forces. Bonus points if you make the song space asshole play

GRAPHICS OVERHAUL (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
----------------------------------------

* HD rocks 
* HD clouds
* HD loading screens
* Try to fix the skybox with clouds just doing a circular motion

* Make all sectors look like EOS
* Reshade

EXPERIMENTS/NOTES
------------------
* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 
* Test adding more than 2 flag stands
* Siege maps has something with persistent flags used on most objects
* Siege maps persistent objects other than the objective don't spawn? or is it just framework?
* Ladders: does making them orphans make them remain usable for longer when buildings are partially damaged?
* King of the Hill targets, Flag capture zones, Spawn nodes, Spectator cameras have values related to backpack racks which are possibly redundant, test if removing these doesn't break objectives.
* Framework: MP version of crane asset?
