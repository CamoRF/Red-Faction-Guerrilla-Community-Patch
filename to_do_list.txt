LOW PRIORITY

[TEXTURE FIXES]
* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)	

[INTERFACE]
* Try to add new texture entries for new multiplayer characters: I tried to duplicate an str2 file, unpack it and rename the cvmb/gvbms, add a new asm entry but the .tga file renamed the same name. The texture just showed up as a single dot in the corner. Using a single placeholder texture for now.

[WEAPONS]
* Add DLC weapons to singleplayer NPC loadouts when RSL2 increases the cap (squad_loadout.xtbl, squad_progression.xtbl)
* Transfer DLC weapon icons and reticules to base game
* Fix missing textures on some of the DLC weapons

[SINGLEPLAYER]
* Apply changes from base game to DLC 
* Port base game vehicles to DLC
