v1.06x
------------

[Fixes]
* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* Fix grenade (seems to randomly stop working when played online and character tposes, weapon also breaks if unique ID is changed from 33, might need to be scripted in future)
* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
* Fix grinder projectile texture
* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket
* Use mp_explosion_overrides.xtbl for explosion changes so it doesn't mess with singleplayer

[Maps]
* Add a single kaboom pack spawn with only 1 on the rack on overpass and crevice
* Add cliff under maps that are missing it when bounding box makes sense
* Add CTF, Damage Control objectives and backpack racks to WC maps when Nanoforge supports it
* Add more neutral spawns to Siege maps (Framework done)

* Fix out of bounds spots on Excavation, Remnant, Puncture, Warlords and Gradient
* Fix random backpacks on WC maps (requires adding backpack racks I believe)

* Scrapheap: very large and needs mines around the map, has a spawn where you can get stuck in a frame
* Gulch: very large and needs mines around the map
* Ruins: has issues with some of the rocks being hard to climb and the player can get stuck on the spikes on buildings
* Repurcussion: might need adjustments to some of the spawns inside the pipes
* GFWL/Nordic Bonus: Some of the shipping containers are floating
* Complex: remake it from scratch using the vanilla map file
* Watchtower: remake it from scratch using the vanilla map file
* Expansion: bridge changes cleaner when we can clone between maps
* Overpass: needs to be reworked, attackers spawn right next to the shed on the left side of the map, needs more siege objectives
* Pinaccle: experimental spawn flipping fixes that apply only in CTF (try intial and respawn bools for team spawns)

* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns
* Update WC map thumbnails after the maps are polished


[Additions/Changes]
* .exe with match countdown set to 6 seconds
* .exe with match end countdown set to 6 seconds
* Remove blur from RPG explosions?
* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines?
* Improve driving skills of NPCs
* Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to
the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
* Reduce mass of debris
* Merge items from SP and DLC into mp_common.vpp_pc

[Weapons]
* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer if possible and when the dlc melee weapons are added
* Fix spiker missing texture when on ground and the projectile not being visible for other players if they are not the host, Broken DLC weapons might need to be merged into items_mp.vpp_pc? (maybe try an alternative projectile?), testing changing the streaming value to multiplayer in items_3d.xtbl, Try dragging the asm files onto RFGUtil to fix DLC weapons, test remaking the changes to items.vpp_pc
* Fix DLC weapon selection icons and reticules, maybe the bitmap file is important?
