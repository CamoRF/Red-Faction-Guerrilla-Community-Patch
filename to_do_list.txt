---------------
To do
---------------
* Fix spiker missing texture when on ground and the projectile not being visible for other players if they are not the host (maybe try an alternative projectile?), testing changing the streaming value to multiplayer in items_3d.xtbl, Try dragging the asm files onto RFGUtil to fix DLC weapons, test remaking the changes to items.vpp_pc
* Fix DLC weapon selection icons and reticules, maybe the bitmap file is important?
* Fix out of bounds spots on Excavation, Remnant, Puncture, Warlords and Gradient
* Doublecheck the misslepod isn't missing the projectile
* Add drop shadows to dlc01_gameplay_properties.xtbl - wip
* Apply changes from the base game tweak table to the dlc tweak table
* Remove blur from RPG explosions
* Upscale grinder projectile texture
* Add new weapon spawns to more EDF
* Update changelog so its consistent with formatting
* Consistent weapon carry player movement speed
* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines
* Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream
* Reduce size of blood decals, one bullet can result in a super large pool while they are still alive
* Improve driving skills of NPCs
* Reduce EDF density slightly, maybe too many drones
* Increase morale drop for death - 
* Remove Eos versions of NPCs from all sectors except Eos and Oasis
* Remove Kepler from NPC spawns
* Balance difficulties: Casual = just want to blow stuff up, Normal = about average, Hard = Balanced and fair but challenging, Insane = Truly punishing experience 
* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Replace intial loading screen (interface-init_load in misc.vpp_pc and interface.vpp_pc)
* Change Lab Babe to Lab Lady, Stripper to Outcast, Marauder Babe to Marauder Lab Tech
* Test version of Pinaccle with experimental spawn flipping fixes that apply only in CTF
* Add Subverter to Guerrilla tech level

Low Priority 
------------
* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket and clothing that matches the cutscenes and upscale it
* Take new screenshots for thumbnail with new WC maps if they need them  (Eg. Complex)
* Armored Mason in multiplayer
* Increase player cap in custom games above 16 if it needs to be
* Test all maps during day and night and check fog, bloom, moon size and sun texture in dtodx file
* Use mp_explosion_overrides.xtbl for explosion changes so it doesn't mess with singleplayer
* Add cliff under maps that are missing it when bounding box makes sense
* Add CTF and Damage Control objective to WC maps when Nanoforge supports it
* Add kaboom pack spawns to some maps?
* Add neutral spawns to Siege maps as done with Framework
* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
* Fix formatting for all XTBL files
* Try to fix CTF spawn flips (try intial and respawn bools for team spawns)
* Fix random backpacks on WC maps (requires adding backpack racks I believe)
* Fix grenade (seems to randomly stop working when played online and character tposes, weapon also breaks if unique ID is changed from 33, might need to be scripted in future)
* Add more spawns to Scrap Heap along with buildings near the invisible wall, map is quite large (alternative map)
* Update WC map thumbnails if they changed a lot after ATMs work
* Increase player movement speed in multiplayer
* Increase jump height in multiplayer - doesn't seem possible

----
