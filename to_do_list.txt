LOW PRIORITY 
-------------------

[Weapons]
	* Spiker: missing textures when on ground, only host can see the projectile (peg file related most likely)
	* DLC remote charges: missing textures, missing mesh when thrown (peg file related most likely)
	* Pickaxe and Impaler: missing textures in all circumstances (peg file again)
	* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer and when the dlc melee weapons are added
	* Weapon ideas: 
		- Singularity launcher
		- Gauss shotgun, 
		- Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to 	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
	* Add Spiker to singleplayer and add it to Marauder loadout	

[Texture Fixes]
	* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
	* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off

	* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket		
	
[Interface]

	* Re-do the vanilla versions of DLC wc maps
	* Make sure all files are compressed and/or condensed properly (eg. str2 files, can use .cmd script to check original flags)
	* Generate xdeltas for interface.vpp_pc, items.vpp_pc, humans.vpp_pc, maps and misc.vpp_pc
