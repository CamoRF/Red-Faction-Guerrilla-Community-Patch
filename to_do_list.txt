----------------------
DONE/ADD TO CHANGELOG
----------------------

* Fixed some vanilla issues with squads

-------------------
LOW PRIORITY 
-------------------

[Weapons]
	* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer and when the dlc melee weapons are added
	* Weapon ideas: 
		- Singularity launcher
		- Gauss shotgun, 
		- Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to 	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
	* Add Spiker to singleplayer and add it to Marauder loadout	

[Texture Fixes]
	* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
	* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
	* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
	* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
	* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket		
	
[Interface]	
	* Profile saving hud element can get stuck on screen in multiplayer games sometimes
	* Issue with double text for the you won/you lost text at end of game with large text over the top of small text	

[Misc]
	* Move other non essential gameplay changes to add-on when found
	* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines

[Vehicles]
	* Walker camera jerk when explosion nearby or swing down onto a car
	* Increase mouse sensitivity in walkers
	
------------------------------------------------
OTHER PROJECTS/ADDONS/OUT OF SCOPE/NOTES
------------------------------------------------

* HD character textures 
* HD weapons and backpack textures
* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Increase morale drop for death
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* Release gravity control script on FF after some refinements
* Missions where you fly the EDF fliers or bombers and take out EDF bases on mountains 
* Stunt jump activities
* More demo master activities 
* More fleshed out world with more buildings etc
* Vehicles driving on roads without traffic like FFZ and EOS end game after the missions are completed
* Space asshole: player causes as much chaos in a given sector while being attacked by progressively more overwhelming forces. Bonus points if you make the song space asshole play
* Renaming characters to DLC sams default str2 could be used for model swaps
* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 
* Tutorial area map
* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
* NPCs have trouble with handling larger vehicles
* EOS Edf Assault Command Mission: Ally NPCs need to be more aggressive and fight beside you but get stuck and lag behind the player, would be better if they could push foward better as enemies are cleared out, buff number of friendlies as only 4 guerrillas and marauders spawn at a time.
