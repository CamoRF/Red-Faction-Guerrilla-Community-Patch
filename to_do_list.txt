(maybe try an alternative projectile?), testing changing the streaming value to multiplayer in items_3d.xtbl, Try dragging the asm files onto RFGUtil to fix DLC weapons, test remaking the changes to items.vpp_pc

OTHER PROJECTS/ADDONS/OUT OF SCOPE/NOTES
------------------------------------------------

* HD character textures 
* HD weapons and backpack textures
* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Increase morale drop for death
* Tanks and the bulldozer scare NPCs and they drive like maniacs
* Increase gravity slightly, jumping feels floaty
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- I'd balance it generally around Normal and Hard as the defaults.
	- Casual is pretty self-explanatory, and Insane would be a semi-realistic guerrilla warfare simulation.
	- Then the game has something to offer everyone. You can sandbox and dick around with little trouble, get an average middle of the road mix of challenge and story, get a balanced challenge that requires you to use hit and run tactics with forward thinking, or get a true realistic challenge of guerrilla skill and tactics that will push you in a desperate struggle for freedom. 
	-  Stealth in vanilla is pretty much useless, so implementing those fixes would make stealth a much more viable option. I think in general we want to lean the player towards using guerrilla tactics on higher difficulties.
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* player_female.xtbl could maybe be used to fix player model swaps in SP
