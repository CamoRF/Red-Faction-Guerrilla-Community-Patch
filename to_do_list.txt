-------------------
LOW PRIORITY 
-------------------

[Weapons]
	* Add CTF flags, Gutter, Impaler and DLC Pickaxe to the sledgehammer upgrade list in multiplayer if possible and when the dlc melee weapons are added
	* Fix spiker missing texture when on ground and the projectile not being visible for other players if they are not the host, Broken DLC weapons might need to be merged into items_mp.vpp_pc? (maybe try an alternative projectile?), testing changing the streaming value to multiplayer in items_3d.xtbl, Try dragging the asm files onto RFGUtil to fix DLC weapons, test remaking the changes to items.vpp_pc
	* Fix DLC weapon selection icons and reticules, maybe the bitmap file is important?
	* Weapon ideas: Singularity launcher, Gauss shotgun, Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to
	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
	* Add Spiker to singleplayer and add it to Marauder loadout	
	* Try adding Marauder charge placer, Spiker, Pickaxe and Royal Sword/Impaler weapons when the peg tool is out

[Fixes]
	* Fix typos (build>built, fo>for) in "ui_blueprint_hammer" texture
	* Fix dates in eos_war_memorial texture, it should be 2075 and 2077, its 5 years off
	* Fix missing texture on Marauder lady
	* Fix "cem_base01_wkpp" missing specular texture (test at Parker's shack)
	* Restore Dan Masons yellow jacket		
	* Issue with double text for the you won/you lost text at end of game with large text over the top of small text	

[Maps] 	
	* Expansion: make bridge changes cleaner when we can clone between maps
	* Add CTF, Damage Control objectives and backpack racks to WC maps when Nanoforge supports it	
	* Tutorial area map

[Misc]
	* Move other non essential gameplay changes to add-on (alert_level.xtbl for example)	
	* Try to make it so you can walk up steeper inclines if possible
	* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
	* Reduce mass of debris?

OTHER PROJECTS/ADDONS/OUT OF SCOPE/NOTES
------------------------------------------------

* HD character textures 
* HD weapons and backpack textures
* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Increase morale drop for death
* Tanks and the bulldozer scare NPCs and they drive like maniacs
* Increase gravity slightly, jumping feels floaty
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- I'd balance it generally around Normal and Hard as the defaults.
	- Casual is pretty self-explanatory, and Insane would be a semi-realistic guerrilla warfare simulation.
	- Then the game has something to offer everyone. You can sandbox and dick around with little trouble, get an average middle of the road mix of challenge and story, get a balanced challenge that requires you to use hit and run tactics with forward thinking, or get a true realistic challenge of guerrilla skill and tactics that will push you in a desperate struggle for freedom. 
	-  Stealth in vanilla is pretty much useless, so implementing those fixes would make stealth a much more viable option. I think in general we want to lean the player towards using guerrilla tactics on higher difficulties.
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* player_female.xtbl could maybe be used to fix player model swaps in SP
