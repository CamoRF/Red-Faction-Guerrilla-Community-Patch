MAPS (LOW PRIORITY)
-------------------
* Ruins: Add Damage Control

* New siege maps: Add team spawn children to siege objectives
* Siege maps: More backpack spawns when played in other modes
* Downfall: Fix the out of bounds exploit near the middle hill and re-enable it
* Aerial Excation: Missing ported smokestack asset, remake remaster when NF rewrite is out and supports asset transfer. Also SF to support xdelta patching newly added files.
* Pipeline Pitfall: Add forcefield that lines up with the invisible wall (low priority) and need SF to support xdelta patching newly added files.

NANOFORGE BUGS (Possibly with world_anchors)
---------------------------------------------
* Frost: The crane is glitchy, cloned floating smokestack when bottom is destroyed, place barrels up on high cliff where buildings collapse, Garrison time of day as alternative?
* Expansion: cloned floating crates when bridge is destroyed

MISC
----
* Add comments for string names in .xtbl files 
* Updated weather files in dlc3 misc file or removing them there since misc seems to override it?
* Can dlc02_text and dlc03_text be merged into misc.vpp_pc?

CHARACTERS
----------
* Add new character thumbnails when peg tool is out
* Restore Torvald, Bev, Chuck, Selma, Kayla, Blair, Numah, & Pierce to multiplayer roster and add ones missing from RF team when hardcoded limit for character grid is bumped
* Add Alec Mason (Armor) to RF team when hardcoded limit for character_grid is bumped in RSL2

BACKPACKS
----------
* Try to fix how stealth pack casts a player shadow that other players can see

TEXTURE FIXES
-------------
* See known bugs in changelog.txt

WRECKING CREW MODE
------------------
* Fallfactor, overpass, deadzone and crash site wrecking crew versions when NF rewrite is out so I can see general movers and fix floating barrels

WEAPONS
-------
* Nano grenade weapon when regular grenade is more refined and items_inventory.xtbl limit is bumped
* Singularity that explodes in 1 second named Instant Singularity Bomb
* Fix DLC weapon icons and reticules by figuring out how to port them to the base game, something to do with bitmap.xtbl and peg files
* Retexture super gauss rifle to make it easier to tell apart from regular gauss rifle? (white?) (they seem to share the same texture however)
* Implement Royal Sword, Pickaxe, Marauder Remote Charges when the peg tool is out
* Weapon ideas: Singularity launcher, Gauss shotgun, Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
* Misslepod: too much smoke and particles for such small damage, maybe change it to a smaller explosion effect.
* Overpowered version of weapons: Grinder etc

SINGLEPLAYER
------------
* Make it so you don't lose alert level when going to a safehouse
* NPC and vehicle overhaul
* Re-port DLC vehicles to base game when modinfo.xml is supported in SF
* Try to make NPCs respond to player from longer distances 
* Increase squad sizes (x8 for workers/rf, x4 for EDF)
* Overhaul vehicle handling
* Re-implement DLC weapons
* Re-implement misc changes (see reverted changes in changelog.txt)
* Try to make it so EDF withdraw from liberated sectors (see territories.xtbl)
* Fix EDF/NPCs spawning really close to player: (tweak_table.xtbl, spawn_parameters.xtbl) and other squad files?
* EDF attack on sight if you're holding a gun 
* Hit and run gameplay on higher difficulties
* EDF should be hostile if you have weapons on your vehicle
* Try to fix not being able to fast travel in Dust
* Add vehicles driving on roads without traffic like FFZ and EOS end game after the missions are completed
* Ore deposits drop 1 piece of salvage instead of 2
* Make it so you can't buy all the backpacks from the start 
* EOS Edf Assault Command Mission: Ally NPCs need to be more aggressive and fight beside you but get stuck and lag behind the player, would be better if they could push foward better as enemies are cleared out, buff number of friendlies as only 4 guerrillas and marauders spawn at a time. (eos_edf_command_assault.png)
* The hammer should be less powerful
* Stealth should last 7 sec
* The aptly named Rhino "charge" isn't a charge, but a step forward.
* Reduce the price of Heal, Tremor and Jetpack (300>200/300>200/ 700>600+300 for recharge). 
* Increase the price of Rhino, Damage boost and Stealth by 25%. The rest of the packs that I haven't mentioned don't need changes. 
* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
* Guerilla Express unlocks in 3-8 Guerrilla Actions
* 290 out of 300 deposits but you have 6000> salvage. 
* Increase morale drop for death
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Not enough checkpoints for missions
* Allies are useless, worse they will get in your line of fire and if you are firing a thermobaric rocket and kill yourself.
* Civilians run around aimlessly while you are trying to finish a mission (sniper mission in EOS especially)
* Unlimited enemies that keep spawning right behind you (pet peeve of mine in games)
* Receive no salvage (including morale bonus) from missions.
* More checkpoints 	
* Speaking of Badlands, makes little sense that both RF and EDF can spawn in the Irradiated Zone. I think that's also a result of 1.063?
* More usage for salvage: upgrading vehicles (swapping out vehicles for ones with guns, repairing vehicles, adding armor, adding moab from safehouse)
* Bug with essential bridge not spawning near the end of the game: non destructible bridge has only half loaded in and means you can't finish the game. One of the last missions you're tasked with destroying enemies and protecting a truck to its destination, issue is you're not following the truck yourself, you're tracking it with a missile launcher and the truck goes to where this bridge should be and drops down and loops back round over and over again.
  The game itself thinks it's there, in and out of mission the AI just straight drives off it, waypoints (which normally divert around destroyed bridges) just go straight across the gap.
* Manual Override mission: EDF scouts spawn around the truck failing th e mission, sometimes the truck will either get stuck and/or flip and if you splash enemies next to it you deal ridiculous amounts of friendly fire
* it is the second to last mission in eos the one that has you protect the truck with the missile that will be loaded with the nano forge, I agree, the mission of escorting Vasha's truck is extreme RNG. The truck is so weak that you can't afford to splash the EDF next to it. Sometimes the truck will get stuck and Marauders will abandon it. Other times it just flips when trying to drive around wreckage. 
* Allow player to use horn in vehicles
* Add grenade to singleplayer
* Make it so explosions can destroy metal beams
* Make it so civilians are no longer bullet sponges
* Headshots are now insta kill?
* Make it so Mason isn't a bullet sponge?
* Make it so grenades can now insta kill the player?
* Make it so you can shoot the wings off EDF flyers
* Safehouses that save your vehicle if you drive them there like GTA
* What I personally feel would be an interesting dynamic is if the EDF could actually gain back control.
	- Maybe not once a sector is fully liberated, but during the storyline in that sector.
	- If you fail a Guerrilla action or morale takes too big of a hit, the EDF gains control while you lose morale.
	- And as a consequence, leveled EDF structures might be repaired.
	- Turning it into a constant struggle for the edge in the power dynamic.
* Air traffic control mission where stealth is heavily implied but it just doesnâ€™t matter

RUINS INTERIOR MAP
------------------
* Add more fire on ground 
* Remove buildings that have floors that can be destroyed
* Test if setting buildings to indestructable means they can work with shape cutters still

CRASHSITE INTERIOR MAP
-----------------------
* None of the buildings are positioned correctly yet, wait until NF rewrite

SHIPMENT REMAKE
----------------
* Test if making barrels invulernable means they can't be destroyed
* Transfer crates from Expansion, destroyed vehicle debris and shipping container assets from GFWL
* Quarantine map as base?

MISC (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
---------------------------
* Quick Save hotkey 
* First person: Remove Alec Masons head, replace weapon models with ones for first person, reduce clipping, change animations, script to switch back to third person in vehicles
* More fleshed out world with more buildings etc
* HD character textures
* HD weapon textures
* HD decals
* HD effects
* HD cubemap in always loaded in misc.vpp
* HD backpacks
* HD clouds
* HD moon, sun etc in that always loaded peg file
* HD Loading screens
* Is that gritty border I made for thumbnails on one of my backup SSDs?
* Could extract the old HD loading screens and thumbnails from old version of patch
* WC versions of Quarantine, Excavation, Rift, Fallfactor, Crashsite and Deadzone
* Kill unkillable NPCs
* You can replace Alec in SP by directly porting DLC sam, rfg_pc_dlc overwrites his file? (player_female.xtbl could maybe be used to fix player model swaps in SP)
* They imply there are other lone guerrillas like Mason out in the field pulling jobs for the Red Faction and doing stuff, AKA heroes of their own story, but it's very poorly shown in the game itself lol.

NEW MISSIONS (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
-----------------------------------
* Missions where you fly the EDF fliers or bombers and take out EDF bases on mountains 
* Stunt jump activities
* More demo master activities 
* EDF counter attack set after main story (based on Sams post game dialogue)
* Mission where you destroy the EDF fliers, you can kill everyone and you get a red alert
* Space asshole: player causes as much chaos in a given sector while being attacked by progressively more overwhelming forces. Bonus points if you make the song space asshole play

GRAPHICS OVERHAUL (OUT OF SCOPE/ADD-ONS)
----------------------------------------
* Rewrite graphics improvement script for RSL2
* HD character textures 
* HD weapons and backpack textures
* HD rocks 
* HD clouds
* HD loading screens
* Try to fix the skybox with clouds just doing a circular motion
* Upscale .bik videos with Topez Video Enhance

* Reshade

EXPERIMENTS/NOTES
------------------
* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 
* Test adding more than 2 flag stands
* Siege maps has something with persistent flags used on most objects
* Siege maps persistent objects other than the objective don't spawn? or is it just framework?
* Ladders: does making them orphans make them remain usable for longer when buildings are partially damaged?
* King of the Hill targets, Flag capture zones, Spawn nodes, Spectator cameras have values related to backpack racks which are possibly redundant, test if removing these doesn't break objectives.
* Framework: MP version of crane asset?
* Health pickups
