*---------*
TO DO LIST
*---------*

TESTING

* Test complex kaboom removal 
* Test frost kaboom removal
* Test location of bag on factory 
* Test damage control target names on quarantine custom map

MISC
----
* Add missing vanilla value comments from some files, some of them have a note in the .xtbl already
* Add formatted versions of optimized files
* Reconstructor effect not appearing randomly, test if restarting game fixes it

CHARACTERS
----------
* Add new character thumbnails when peg tool is out

TEXTURE FIXES
-------------
* See known bugs in changelog.txt

WRECKING CREW MODE
------------------
* Fallfactor, overpass, deadzone and crash site wrecking crew versions when NF rewrite is out so I can see general movers and fix floating barrels

WEAPONS
-------
* Grenade and fist weapons
* Singularity that explodes in 1 second named Instant Singularity Bomb
* Fix DLC weapon icons and reticules by figuring out how to port them to the base game, something to do with bitmap.xtbl and peg files
* Retexture super gauss rifle to make it easier to tell apart from regular gauss rifle? (white?)
* Implement Spiker, Royal Sword, Pickaxe, Marauder Remote Charges when the peg tool is out
* Weapon ideas: Singularity launcher, Gauss shotgun, Flamethrower using Arc Welder as a base; Flame thrower weapon using reconstructor with Nano Rifle stream, kind of worked with using reconstructor and changing some values to 	the cut turret flamethrower weapon, issues were it either didn't have any ammo or it got stuck firing. Maybe arc_welder could work better
* Misslepod: too much smoke and particles for such small damage

MAPS
----
* Imperial: Place artillery sign near the out of bounds rock
* Watchtower: Place artillery sign near the out of bounds rock
* Siege maps: more backpack spawns when played in other modes, add propane tank weapons near attacker spawn
* All maps: more DLC weapon spawns, Double check all spawns have "initial spawn" and "respawn enabled" along with neutral spawn gamemode flags disabled in CTF on all regular mp maps, Doublecheck all backpack racks and DCT racks are persistent, along with their children, Enable all objects in inspector in case there's weird cover nodes etc on all maps
* New siege maps: Add team spawn children to siege objectives
* Expansion: Killbox near cliff warning sign needs refinement

* Transmission: Add some walls when Nanoforge rewrite is out
* Vista: Add jetpack spawn
* Framework: Add CTF & Damage Control
* Flag stands and damage control targets don't need to be persistent
* Make sure neutral spawns are enabled on CTF WC maps
* Disable CTF on WC maps without team spawns
* Disable siege on new maps without proper spawns?
* Doublecheck if sun texture is broken on assembly/outpost

LOW PRIORITY MAP STUFF
-----------------------
* Siege maps has something with persistent flags used on most objects
* Siege maps persistent objects other than the objective don't spawn? or is it just framework?
* Test adding multiple bagman spawns to randomize where it respawns 
* Test adding more than 2 flag stands
* Ladders: does making them orphans make them remain usable for longer when buildings are partially damaged?
* Frost: The crane is glitchy, cloned floating smokestack when bottom is destroyed, place barrels up on high cliff where buildings collapse, Garrison time of day as alternative?
* Expansion: cloned floating crates when bridge is destroyed
* Scrapheap: Add damage control & CTF 
* Vista: Add damage control & CTF
* Ruins: Add damage control
* Framework: Move flag stands, EDF spawn on top of the hill behind the buildings, RF spawn at the back near the mines and re-enable it in mp_levels.xtbl
* Framework: MP version of crane asset?
* Quarantine siege and new map file version: Add more spectator cameras outside the map

RUINS INTERIOR MAP
------------------

SANDPIT KOTH
-------------
* Use puncture weather and time of day
* Transfer heat haze and fire assets to map 
* Small smokestack in distance is too high
* 180 the small shack near the middle of the map
* Raise the large building added a tiny bit
* Fence clipping through one of the smokestacks
* Add more objects outside the maybe
* Attempt to transfer the solar tower asset from cascade or gauntlet and add it at that empty area at the opposite side of the map as the large building
* Move the shack next to it closer to the middle, next to the fence/backpacks

SINGLEPLAYER ADD-ON
--------------------
* Re-implement DLC weapons in singleplayer
* Re-implement vehicle and npc overhaul
* Re-implement DLC vehicles
* Re-implement misc changes (see reverted changes in changelog.txt)
* Try to make it so EDF withdraw from liberated sectors (see territories.xtbl)
* Fix EDF/NPCs spawning really close to player: tweak_table.xtbl, spawn_parameters.xtbl and other squad files?
* Implement some of changes from the Community Pack
* EDF attack on sight if you're holding a gun 
* Hit and run gameplay on higher difficulties
* EDF should be hostile if you have weapons on your vehicle
* Vehicle handling overhaul
* NPC and vehicle overhaul
* Makes no sense you can't fast travel in Dust. Or that you have to chase the 1 piece of salvage that decided to fly the fuck away from you.
* The hammer should be less powerful.
* Stealth should last 7 sec, it's broken as fuck.
* The aptly named Rhino "charge" isn't a charge, but a step forward.
* Reduce the price of Heal, Tremor and Jetpack (300>200/300>200/ 700>600+300 for recharge). 
* Increase the price of Rhino, Damage boost and Stealth by 25%. The rest of the packs that I haven't mentioned don't need changes. 
* Improve driving skills of NPCs (reduce AI speed)
* NPCs have trouble with handling larger vehicles
* Guerilla Express unlocks in 3-8 Guerrilla Actions
* Ore deposits drop 1 piece of salvage instead of 2
* Make it so you can't buy all the backpacks from the start 
* EOS Edf Assault Command Mission: Ally NPCs need to be more aggressive and fight beside you but get stuck and lag behind the player, would be better if they could push foward better as enemies are cleared out, buff number of friendlies as only 4 guerrillas and marauders spawn at a time. (eos_edf_command_assault.png)
* Kill unkillable NPCs
* Increase morale drop for death
* You can replace Alec in SP by directly porting DLC sam, rfg_pc_dlc overwrites his file? (player_female.xtbl could maybe be used to fix player model swaps in SP)
* 290 out of 300 deposits but you have 6000> salvage. 
* Gameplay changes 
	- Salvage balancing, too expensive on normal and hard 
	- Improve vehicle handling 
	- Reduce EDF accuracy 
	- Vehicle handling overhaul 
	- Rebalance side activity pro times
	- Make EDF withdraw from liberated sectors
	- Uncap alert level during missions in scriptx files
	- Casual = Swat EDF like flies and blow shit up as the ultimate space asshole.
    - Normal = An average mix of sandbox fun and tactical combat. Nothing too heavy.
    - Hard = You'll need to think smarter and plan your attacks ahead of time, using guerrilla hit and run tactics and then getting the hell out, if you want to succeed. Challenging, but balanced.
	- Insane = An ultimate test of your guerrilla skills. You stand no chance against the military might of the EDF without careful planning and tactical knowledge in a realistic guerrilla warfare scenario. Where you are but an average man, standing against the overwhelming force of your oppressive military dictators. 
	- Encourage hit and run and stealth

* Unlock Insane difficulty by default
* Not enough checkpoints for missions
* Allies are useless, worse they will get in your line of fire and if you are firing a thermobaric rocket and kill yourself.
* Civilians run around aimlessly while you are trying to finish a mission (sniper mission in EOS especially)
* Unlimited enemies that keep spawning right behind you (pet peeve of mine in games)
* Receive no salvage (including morale bonus) from missions. 	
* Speaking of Badlands, makes little sense that both RF and EDF can spawn in the Irradiated Zone. I think that's also a result of 1.063?
* More usage for salvage: upgrading vehicles (swapping out vehicles for ones with guns, repairing vehicles, adding armor, adding moab from safehouse)
* Mission where you destroy the EDF fliers, you can kill everyone and you get a red alert
* Vehicles driving on roads without traffic like FFZ and EOS end game after the missions are completed
* Space asshole: player causes as much chaos in a given sector while being attacked by progressively more overwhelming forces. Bonus points if you make the song space asshole play
* Bug with essential bridge not spawning near the end of the game: non destructible bridge has only half loaded in and means you can't finish the game. One of the last missions you're tasked with destroying enemies and protecting a truck to its destination, issue is you're not following the truck yourself, you're tracking it with a missile launcher and the truck goes to where this bridge should be and drops down and loops back round over and over again.
  The game itself thinks it's there, in and out of mission the AI just straight drives off it, waypoints (which normally divert around destroyed bridges) just go straight across the gap.
* More checkpoints
