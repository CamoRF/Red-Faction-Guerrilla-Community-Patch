* Doublecheck all wc and siege map backpacks, ctf flags and damage control targets
* Ruins: change weather?
* Watchtower: fix floating heal backpack (test)
* Scrapheap: fix 2d spawn (test)
* Cascade: add stealth backpack spawns at bottom of solar towers
* Retexture super gauss rifle to make it easier to tell apart from regular gauss rifle?
* Re-port all DLC weapons, rename them etc? or maybe just re-do the port of the Spiker and edit its balance in weapons.xtbl, maybe the overrides file broke the projectile?
