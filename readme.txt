MANUAL INSTALLATION
--------------------

1. Ensure you're not using any mod manager mods and have verified your game files, select "restore default files" in mod manager to restore the table.vpp_pc file and then verify your game in steam by right clicking it in your Steam library > Properties > Local Files > "Verify integrity of game files". You can ignore this step if you're sure you have a clean vanilla install

2. Navigate to your "Red Faction Guerrilla Re-MARS-tered" folder, you can find it in the same section where you verify your files and clicking "browse" or find it manually by finding "Steam\steamapps\common\Red Faction Guerrilla Re-MARS-tered\"

3. Backup the following files in "Red Faction Guerrilla Re-MARS-tered\data\": dlcp02_interface.vpp_pc, interface.vpp_pc, items.vpp_pc, misc.vpp_pc, table.vpp_pc, vehicles_r.vpp_pc, wc1.vpp_pc, wc2.vpp_pc, wc3.vpp_pc, wc4.vpp_pc, wc5.vpp_pc, wc6.vpp_pc, wc7.vpp_pc, wc8.vpp_pc, wc9.vpp_pc, wc10.vpp_pc, wcdlc1.vpp_pc, wcdlc2.vpp_pc, wcdlc3.vpp_pc, wcdlc4.vpp_pc, wcdlc5.vpp_pc, wcdlc6.vpp_pc, wcdlc7.vpp_pc, wcdlc8.vpp_pc and wcdlc9.vpp_pc. (You can ignore this step if you're okay with verifying your game in steam to restore to vanilla if you need to)

4. Extract the .7z file and drag and drop the "data" folder to "Red Faction Guerrilla Re-MARS-tered" where the rfg.exe is located. You will be asked if you want to overwrite, select yes to all.
